      <description>Our questions about the meaning of life led to its relationships to two main human institutions from which people seek understanding — religion (especially theology) and science. In this section, we consider the relationship between questions about the meaning of life and the capacities of these institutions.

      <description>In Plato&amp;rsquo;s Gorgias we encountered two conflicting versions of the meaning of life, and we discussed philosophy as an approach to questions. Now we turn our focus to what&amp;rsquo;s puzzling about the meaning of life. We can ask “What&amp;rsquo;s the meaning of life?” But that is just the opening move. What are the other questions we might want to ask in order to begin to answer that question? When we face difficult problems, often understanding the question is half the battle!</description>

 Still, philosophy has a history. And its history involves people doing specific things and calling them “philosophy,” and not calling other things “philosophy.</description>

      <description>This is the participation rubric to be used for grading participation in this course. Read it as saying “A student who demonstrates … earns a grade of X,” where X is the letter grade at the top of the column.1
   A B C D F     Active role in discussions, drawing on texts Regular, constructive participation drawing on texts Inconsistent constructive participation based on texts Vague comments reflecting limited engagement with texts Persistent lack of engagement with texts   Full preparation for approximately every class Substantial preparation, normally Inconsistent evidence of preparation Rare evidence of participation No positive evidence of participation   Success at advancing level and depth of discussion, persistently Regular contributions based on assigned material, which sometimes improve discussion and never diminish it Rare or no significant contribution to the level of discussion while not reducing it Activity sometimes diminishing the discussion and the classroom environment Activity regularly diminishing the discussion and the classroom environment   Active engagement with and listening to peers, persistently Sincere efforts to interact with peers, normally Limited engagement with peers Rare interaction with peers No interaction with peers      This rubric is significantly based on, and lightly adapted from, one written by another philosophy professor, Jay Odenbaugh.</description>
