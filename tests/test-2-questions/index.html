<h2 id="instructions">Instructions</h2>
<p>To take this test, you do not need to log in to Zoom. All the instructions appear below. However, there will be an Zoom session open during our assigned exam time (10:30–12:30), where you can find me on chat. After that, please contact me through email with any questions.</p>
<p>The following questions are designed to take you not more than 90 minutes. This is a final assessment, not a big project. You should type out your answers in your own document. It will be due, via upload, by 5 PM, on Saturday, December 5. I would encourage you to consider doing it sooner than that, so it&rsquo;s not hanging over you. The upload link is on Blackboard under the Tests button, as “Test 2.”</p>
<p>In answering the following questions, use the texts and your notes. Do not rely on external sources — that is, other than the texts assigned for the course and your notes — for two reasons: (1) You will not get credit for repeating someone else&rsquo;s analysis and discussion; I&rsquo;m asking for yours. (2) You are required to acknowledge in the text anything that you&rsquo;ve used to construct your answers other than the course texts and your notes. Using but not acknowledging them would mean a 0 grade for the test. So, scrupulously avoid that!</p>
<h2 id="questions">Questions</h2>
<p>Read the following five questions, and then pick three of them to answer. For each of those three questions, write at least 12 sentences. You may write a little more than that, if it helps you explain things, but not more than about double that, like 24 sentences.</p>
<ol>
<li>If Mill and Callicles the sophist (as depicted by Plato) each had one week to live, how would they probably approach life differently, based on the ideas about the best life for human beings attributed to them in the texts we read? As you answer that question, include a few brief examples.</li>
<li>In what ways, according to Seachris, does a good life resemble a good story? Then, developing a brief example, what is one reason to think that one could have a good life that wouldn&rsquo;t necessarily be a good story?</li>
<li>Other than connection with reality, What are two properties Nozick thinks “most people” value in a life? (Explain briefly.) Then, what kinds of lives might be valuable — even idea — despite that they do <em>not</em>  have those two properties?</li>
<li>We discussed ways that different accounts of the meaning of life might understand the question “What is the meaning of life?” differently, as being equivalent to different questions. What are some of those questions, and how might they produce different kinds of answers to what the meaning of life is?</li>
<li>Using as examples <em>either</em>  “the Makropulos Case” presented by Williams, or Swift&rsquo;s imaginary city, why might a life that ends in death be able to be more meaningful than a life that does not?</li>
</ol>
