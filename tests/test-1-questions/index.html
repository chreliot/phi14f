<main>
<p>Here are the questions for the first test. The test will be from a subset of these questions. For each question, write at least five sentences (minimum) and perhaps a bit more than five. Write concisely and informatively. If there is more than one part to the question, make sure to answer all the parts.</p>
<ol>
<li>What is Blackburn&rsquo;s “middle-ground” defense of philosophy.</li>
<li>What is Blackburn&rsquo;s “low-ground” defense of philosophy.</li>
<li>In <em>Apology</em>, what does Socrates say is the greatest good for a human being (“a man”), and what does he say that supports that? (That is, why, according to Socrates, might that the greatest good for a human being?)</li>
<li>In <em>Gorgias</em>, Socrates distinguishes between two forms of persuasion. How, according to him, does this help show why learning philosophy is better than learning what Gorgias teaches?</li>
<li>In <em>Gorgias</em>, Socrates suggests that power isn&rsquo;t always good. Why?</li>
<li>In <em>Gorgias</em>, Socrates suggests that fulfilling our appetites isn&rsquo;t always good. Why?</li>
<li>What are three <em>different</em> ways the existence of God might be relevant to the meaning of our lives?</li>
<li>What, in your view, is the most questionable premise in Anselm&rsquo;s “First Way” argument. How might Anselm try to talk about it being true?</li>
<li>How does a <em>reductio ad absurdum</em> argument work, and what is the absurdity Gaunilo uses in his rebuttal to Anselm&rsquo;s proof of the existence of God?</li>
<li>Does Pascal&rsquo;s argument conclude that God exists? What does it conclude? What, in your view, is successful or promising about the way it argues?</li>
<li>What is the error Wallace suggests most people make in our thinking? How, according to him, might freeing ourselves of that error make our lives better?</li>
<li>What is the main assumption about the nature of reality outside us that stands behind Epictetus&rsquo;s thinking about how we should live?</li>
<li>How might Epictetus respond to the suggestion that a life filled with suffering can&rsquo;t be a good life?</li>
<li>What is one criticism of the Stoic account of how to live the best possible life?</li>
<li>What idea about the meaning of life, from all of what we&rsquo;ve discussed so far, did you connect with most? Why did it seem compelling to you?</li>
</ol>
