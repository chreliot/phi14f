<p>Your main task is to identify and reconstruct an argument about the meaning of life and then critically evaluate it.</p>
<p>Based on how well you think it works for this task, choose one of the following: (1) the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF8uR6Z6KLc">Steve Jobs speech</a>, or (2) a different speech or text you&rsquo;ve found and cleared with me in advance. That will be your “source text.”</p>
<p>From your source text, reconstruct a statement of the form “The meaning of life is …” <em>or</em> “The way to live is ….” Write it down. That will be the conclusion.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Construct a <em>logically valid</em> argument that supports your conclusion and offers some reason to believe it is true, as found in your source text. The ideal length is probably about three to five premises. Write out the argument in list form, with the premises numbered and the conclusion on the last line. Some advice about doing this: It will probably help to include a premise that elaborates on how the text implicitly or implicitly understands (as relevant) the meaning of life or the way to live. How does the text support that we could know or think about those things? Then connect that way of knowing to specific content.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Which  premise (or if you prefer, two premises) of your logically valid argument seem most likely to be questioned by someone who is skeptical about the conclusion, or who isn&rsquo;t sure it&rsquo;s well supported? (Write at least 400 words discussing this.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Then, can you think of any way&mdash;whether or not you are sure it works&mdash;for offering further support for this questionable premise (or premises)? What are they? Or, can you think of how this premise might be changed to address criticism? (Write at least 400 words discussing this.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do you agree with either the original argument, or the revised approach (in part 3)? Or, is it missing something? Do you feel that the meaning of life might involve something the argument doesn&rsquo;t mention, or which should be thought about in a different way? What is it? (Write at least 200 words discussing this.)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This is not a research paper, and researching will not contribute significantly to your grade. But you will use a source text. If you use any material from outside the class, other than the Steve Jobs video, please make sure that you have included a citation to it in <em>any  format</em> that allows me to find the specific source page.</p>
<p>The grading criteria for this assignment will be (1) the clarity of your writing, (2) accuracy at presenting the source text, and (3) originality of your analysis.</p>
<p>Submit your assignment by uploading it through the <code>First Assignment</code> upload link under the <code>Assignments</code> button on the course&rsquo;s Blackboard site. Submit your assignment by <strong>October 7</strong> to be on time, or email me if you find you need to request additional time. Do not  submit a copy on paper. On the assignment itself <strong>do not write your name</strong>, to facilitate anonymous reading and grading. Titling your assignment is optional. (You might just put the course number, the date, and something like “First Assignment” at the top of the document, so it&rsquo;s clear to you and me what file it is.)</p>
<p>Please feel welcome to discuss this assignment with me.</p>
