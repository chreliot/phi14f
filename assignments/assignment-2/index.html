<main>
<p>For this writing assignment, you will think about what <em>you</em> mean by the meaning of life. You&rsquo;ll discuss that in a structured way.</p>
<p>Upload your paper through Blackboard upload, under the Assignments button, any day or time before the end of Monday, December 7. Please don&rsquo;t write your name at the top, so I can provide some anonymous feedback.</p>
<p>After a brief, introductory, summarizing paragraph which you should write <em>last</em>, after you&rsquo;ve written all the rest, but place first, construct the following paragraphs. Each numbered item represents a paragraph; it doesn&rsquo;t have to be long.</p>
<h2 id="the-good-or-meaningful">The good or meaningful</h2>
<ol>
<li>Lay out what you think is the source of goodness or meaningfulness in life — the thing that is uniquely capable of making life meaningful. Some possible examples: happiness, human rationality, the love of God, the finitude of human life, memory, our ability to achieve things, etc.    Explain it.</li>
<li>Then motivate it by illustrating it. That is, what <del>are two or more  briefly-described cases</del> is a case in which we can observe this source of goodness contributing  to the meaningfulness of human life?</li>
<li>Then, what is a case where this thing is lacking, and we can observe a lack of  meaningfulness because of the lack of the good thing?</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="an-important-background-fact">An important background fact</h2>
<ol start="4">
<li>Describe an important fact about the world that has relevance for the meaningfulness of life. Explain what you mean.</li>
<li>Describe briefly how you think the world would differ if that fact were not true of it.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="how-to-live">How to live</h2>
<ol start="6">
<li>How should a person live, in order to live a meaningful life, in light of the source of good you describe and the important background fact? Explain.</li>
<li>Offer an example/illustration of how a life could go from meaningless to meaningful by adding the thing you think is good (or more of the thing you think is good), especially in light of the background fact.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="objection-and-reply">Objection and reply</h2>
<ol start="8">
<li>Suppose someone were to object to either your source of good or your background fact. What could they say to reject it?</li>
<li>Why do you think their objection is wrong?</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<ol start="10">
<li>Briefly restate your position in just a couple of sentences.</li>
</ol>
